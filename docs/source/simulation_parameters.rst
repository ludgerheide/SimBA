Simulation Parameters
=====================

The simulation of an eBus-Sytem relies on a variety of simulation parameters.
The eBus-Toolbox provides most of them as default values. Depending on specific needs adjusting
these values can increase the accuracy of the simulation outputs. The eBus-Toolbox input files are described
in detail in the following subsections as well as their default parameters.
When providing the user defined input files, the user should make sure the files are either 'utf-8'
encoded or not contain regional characters.

Schedule
--------

To analyze your own electric bus schedule, the data needs to be provided as a .csv file where each row contains the details of a single trip of that schedule. Find the details about the various columns in this file below. The first table lists the **mandatory** columns while the second one (tbd) lists optional parameters. Refer to `data/examples/trips.csv` for an example.
