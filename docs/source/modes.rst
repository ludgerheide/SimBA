Modes of the eBus-Toolbox
=========================

The eBus-Toolbox assists the user in analysing and optimising electrified bus fleets and schedules. Besides a simple simulation run, several
different modes support the user in finding optimal solutions for their eBus-System. Supported Modes are

* simple simulation
* negative depot to opportunity charger
* negative opportunity to depot charger
* station optimization


simple simulation
-----------------
The simple simulation case is the default mode. Its usage is explained in :ref:`Getting Started`
